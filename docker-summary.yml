Have two seperate docker servers:
1. Build Server
2. Deployment Server

Dockerfile creates images which leads to the creation of containers

Images are obtained from registry (Docker Hub)

Push images from docker build server to dockerhub
- docker push 
- now have image repos that can be private or public

Pull images into the docker deployment server
-
